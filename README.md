# Elderly Studies: Aging as a Mythological Cognitive Construction

This repository collects **materials, coding files, and conceptual diagrams** for the project  
**“Aging as a Mythological Cognitive Construction”** (working title).

The project examines how **aging is imagined, feared, and narrated** as a kind of “mythological” cognitive construction:  
how people draw on cultural myths, interpersonal experience, and everyday cognitive habits to make sense of becoming old.

> **Note:**  
> This repository is primarily a **research workspace and documentation archive**.  
> It stores abstracts, literature review notes, interview guides, coding books, and concept maps.  
> It is **not** a polished software package and **not** a full open-data release of all interview materials.

## 1. Project overview

### Research questions

The study is broadly concerned with:

- How do individuals **conceptually construct “aging”**—as decline, growth, burden, destiny, or myth?
- Which **“aging myths”** (e.g., inevitable dependence, emotional coldness, wisdom vs. uselessness) are most salient in people’s narratives?
- How do **fear of aging**, **interpersonal relationships**, and **cognitive habits** interact with these myths?
- How do people **adjust their behavior** once their attitudes toward aging change (e.g., after a health event, caregiving experience, or contact with older adults)?

### Approach

The project uses a **qualitative, interview-based design** with systematic coding:

1. **Semi-structured interviews** guided by a common question list (see `interview/`).
2. **Thematic and myth-focused coding** of transcripts, with a detailed coding book (see `编码簿 - 衰老 - 2024-8-25.docx` and files under `coding/`).
3. **Concept mapping** of key constructs such as:
   - “Cognition of aging myth”
   - “Fear of aging”
   - “Behavioral adjustments following changes in attitude”
   - Interpersonal relationships and cognitive habits as they intersect with aging myths.
4. Integration of these elements into a **mythological–cognitive model of aging**, summarized in the main paper  
   `Aging as a mythological cognitive construction.pdf`.
